# BuzzVerse Monitoring Firmware

Welcome to the BuzzVerse Science Club's embedded firmware repository! This firmware, based on the ESP-IDF framework, is tailored for ESP-32-C3 microcontrollers with LoRa communication capabilities, providing a powerful solution for monitoring applications. Whether you're a club member, a fellow student, or an enthusiast, feel free to explore our firmware, contribute, and join us in advancing monitoring technologies.

## Overview

Our monitoring firmware leverages the ESP-IDF framework, ESP-32-C3 microcontrollers, and LoRa communication for efficient and long-range data transfer. This project aims to address monitoring needs across various domains, including environmental sensing, industrial monitoring, and more.

## Features

- **ESP-IDF Framework**: Utilizing the ESP-IDF framework for robust and feature-rich firmware development.
- **ESP-32-C3 Microcontroller**: Harnessing the capabilities of the ESP-32-C3 for reliable and efficient embedded monitoring applications.
- **LoRa Communication**: Enabling long-range communication for data transfer in monitoring scenarios.

## Getting Started

To use the monitoring firmware in your project:

1. **Install ESP-IDF**: Follow the [ESP-IDF installation guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) to set up the ESP-IDF framework.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using <br> `git clone https://github.com/BuzzVerse/lora_esp32_firmware.git`.

3. **Integrate Sensors**: Customize the firmware by integrating sensors relevant to your monitoring application.

4. **Configure LoRa Settings**: Adjust LoRa communication parameters based on your deployment requirements.

5. **Build and Flash**: Use the ESP-IDF build system to build the firmware and flash it onto your ESP-32-C3 device.
